# Key Factors in Global Freelancer Ratings 📊

This README provides a description of the analysis performed in the `Key_Factors_in_Global_Freelancer_Ratings.ipynb` notebook.

## Project Description 📝

This project is a comprehensive exploration of a global freelancers dataset, focusing on identifying the key factors that influence their ratings. **This kernel is based on and forked from an insightful original work by Devrai Brian Risk, with additional modifications and improvements made.** The notebook covers data preparation, visualization, and predictive modeling to understand the dynamics contributing to freelancer performance.

## Key Features and Analysis 🔍

* **Data Cleaning:** Addresses issues such as non-numeric characters in the hourly rate column to ensure data integrity. 🧹
* **Data Visualization:** Multiple visualizations are generated to uncover relationships and distributions within the dataset, providing insights into freelancer behavior. 📈
* **Predictive Modeling:** A Random Forest Regressor is utilized to build a predictive model capable of estimating freelancer ratings. 🤖
* **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is assessed using the R² score, indicating the strength of the model's predictions. ✅
* **Feature Importance Analysis:** An analysis is conducted to identify which factors, such as years of experience and hourly rate, exert the most influence on freelancer ratings. 💡

## Future Work 🚀

For future analysis, the following enhancements could be considered:

* **One-Hot Encoding:** Diving deeper into categorical predictors by using techniques like one-hot encoding for skills, language, and country. 🏷️
* **Model Experimentation:** Experimenting with alternate models and hyperparameter tuning to potentially improve predictive performance. 🧪
* **Time-Series Data Incorporation:** Incorporating time-series data, if available, to study freelancer activity trends over time. ⏳

## Tools Used 🛠️

This project was developed using the following tools and Python libraries. Please note that it is not possible to embed logos directly within the Markdown format.

* **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and code presentation.
* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn:** For predictive modeling (e.g., Random Forest Regressor).
* **KaggleHub:** For dataset download.
